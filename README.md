# Scales graphics and reactive library for Scala.js

This is the Scales library for functional graphics, music, and reactive animation,
built with [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/).

Compile with `compile; publishLocal` in `sbt`; this will put the appropriate packages
in your local ivy cache. (Eventually it will be published to a real repository...)
